        known printer took a galley of type 
        and scrambled it to make a type 
        specimen book.  <p className= 'mb-4 text-slate-800'></p>It has survived not only 
        five centuries, but also the leap into 
        electronic typesetting, remaining essen
        tially unchanged. It was popularised in
         the 1960s with the release of Letraset
          sheets containing  <p className= 'mb-4 text-slate-800'></p>Lorem Ipsum passages
